Role description:

Petar:
1. Wrote parts 1 and 2;
2. Modified the game to include 'rotten apples';
3. Converted the game from a Java applet to a Java application;
4. Generated the runnable snake.jar file;
5. Provided support to his teammates whenever he could.

How the rotten apples work:
The rotten apples are black in color and they appear every time the snake eats a red apple and stay on the grid till the end of the game. 
If the snake eats a rotten apple then it dies. Every time the snake eats a red apple, a new random point is generated. 
It (the point) needs to pass a check that it does not belong on a grid tile that contains the snake. This first point becomes the rotten apple.
then another random point is generated for the red apples. It has to pass a check that it does not belong to the snake or to the rotten apples. 
All rotten apples are sotred in a linked list of type point (like the snake).

COnversion to Java application
The class SnakeGame was added. It creates a Jframe for the application and put the applet inside it and provides basic directions to the frame (position and close on exit).
It also contains a main method which makes the application runnable.
